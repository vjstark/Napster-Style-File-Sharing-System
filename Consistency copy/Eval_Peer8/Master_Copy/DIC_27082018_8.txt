3 topics for project

1. Run time Systems (Low level OS) - XTASK -> Optimizing OS
2. Search in Distributed Storage (Medium level to High Level OS) - XSEARCH (Search data, organize it, use it)
3. Variable Precision DeepNeural Networks 

1. Run Time Systems
	- Parallel execution of smaller process using multi threading
	- Moore's law
	- Computation time < 1 ms -- GOOD !
	- Strong Scaling (Fixed prob size) vs Weak Scaling (Multiple probs of variant size)
	- XTASK vs Swift/T
	- Mem Alloc of Linux kernel vs Bitmap MemAlloc

2. Search in Distributed info retrieval in large scale Storage
	- catalogs db
3. Deep Neural Net
