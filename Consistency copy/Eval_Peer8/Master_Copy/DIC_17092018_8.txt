Parallelism 
Break for loop into threads
eg: for loop of 100 can be divided into 4 threads (25 counter each) 

for Fibonacii series:
Create DAG for decomposing 


SIMD -- GPU with multiple core working on single data
MIMD -- Clusters, HPC,Laptops, modern PCs

Parallelism 
1. Bit level 
2. Task level

Threading
1 USer level threads - disad: Process having user level threads will get a specified time to execute. 
	if 2 process are there with 1 process is having one thread and 1 process having 5 threads,
	each of the process will get same time to execute. this is because OS doesnt know how many threads are 
	there in a process.
2 Kernel Level Threads - disad: Expensive to implement


Lockfree :
-- Bakery Algo for lock free
-- Wait freedom
