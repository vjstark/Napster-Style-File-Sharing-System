Intro to Distributed Systems

1. Infinity bands to enhance TCP transmission
2. Switches has cross connections to all ports (bidirectional connection) 
	8 ports -64 mbps
	Normally 40-50 ports switches
3. Factories - create hierarchy of switches to connect to child switches in different rack 
	basically used in Data Center(FB,Google, Argonne National Lab)
4. 3D/5D tores Network --> DragonFly (Used in Scientific Computing)
5. Difference Btwn : Factories vs Tores/DragonFly
6. Clusters/Cloud used for Data center
7. Supercomputer
